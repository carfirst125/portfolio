## Customer Data Platform (CDP)

CDP in Figure 1 can be considered as a Customer Data-driven Platform which is used to deploy digital transformation. Through the CDP platform, new deployed MLAI applications can be experienced by customer as soon as deployed. The company also can get the experiment result by real interaction.

CDP helps collecting customer data from Omni-channels from our data source such as website, mobile app, CRM system, or from association partners such as Ads Publishers (Google Ads, FB Ads, etc.), or purchase data of 3rd Party such as Bluekai, Lotame, etc.

The data are collected to the data lake, and extracted into various data marts for particular usage purpose. Those data marts are used by MLAI applications and Dashboard generation as well.
