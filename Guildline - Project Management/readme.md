## Project Management Overall

Project management could be implemented through 4 major steps:

   * Project Inititating

   * Project Planning

   * Project Executing

   * Project Closing


#### Project Initiating

In the project initiating, project manager (PM) gets the project request/proposal from senior organization leader or company director board. 
PM needs to work closely with the stakeholders to clarify Objectives, Goals, Scope, Delivarables and Timeline of the project.
Those are discussed significantly and noted into the **Project Charter** which aligned among stakeholders.

#### Project Planning 

PM conducts the first project meeting as known as kick-off meeting with team, stakeholder and sponsor to share project vision, goals, scope and understanding individual roles.
