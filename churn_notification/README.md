## Churn Notification

There are a variety of churn model proposals. However, it is not important what it is. The importance is your question, your business issue that you need to find the solution for that. 

In this project, I would like to propose a simple churn model that support you in alert, provide the notification that which customer need contacting by long time without action, and this also means that the customer is nearly going to churn.

## Implementation

One of the most important questions of churn prediction or notification is how to get the value of the Distance to Churn, where a customer could be consulted as churn or not.

This approach suggests using statistical method on the lengths between two continuous purchasing of customers for decide the Distance to Churn
